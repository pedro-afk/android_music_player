# Music Player App

![App Demo](link_to_demo_gif.gif) *(replace `link_to_demo_gif.gif` with the actual link to your demo GIF)*

This is a simple audio player designed to play .mp3 files from your device, allowing you to browse, play, pause, skip between tracks, and adjust the playback position.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter (UI)
- Dart
- Platform Channels
- Android Media APIs
- Kotlin (Native Android components)

## Technical Description

The application utilizes native Android APIs, including `MediaPlayer` and `MediaStore`, to manage audio playback. I've implemented various functions that are invoked through `MethodCall`, which communicates with the Dart programming layer via the platform channel.

## Features

- Scans and lists all .mp3 files present on the device.
- Play and pause audio playback.
- Automatically proceeds to the next track after one finishes.
- Navigate between tracks with ease.
- Adjust the playback position of the audio.
- Dark mode for improved nighttime usage.
- Customizable themes to suit your preferences.
